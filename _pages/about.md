Hi, I'm Martin Eide Lien.
------

I'm a PhD student at the University of Bergen doing a digital histopathology project in cancer biology.

What I'm into
------

- Making software tools that help me and others do better research
- Clean, repeatable analysis (notebooks, pipelines, "it just runs")
- Visuals that tell the story without a lecture

Current focus
------

- Tumors chatting with nearby fat cells (CAAs)
- Stemness + metabolism vibes at the tumor edge
