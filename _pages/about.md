I'm a PhD student at the University of Bergen working on digital histopathology in cancer biology.

I build software tools for research, focusing on clean, repeatable analysis that just works. My current project looks at how tumors interact with nearby fat cells (CAAs) and how stemness and metabolism relate at the fat-tumor edge.
