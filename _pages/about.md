I'm a PhD student at the University of Bergen working on a digital histopathology project in cancer biology.

I build software for research (biomedicine). My current project looks at how tumors interact with nearby fat cells (cancer associated adipocytes) and how stemness and metabolism relate at the fat-tumor edge.
