Publications
======
* **Interactions between neutrophils and macrophages harboring gram-negative bacteria promote obesity-associated breast cancer.** *Cancer Cell* (in review), 2024.  
  S. T. Takle, S. M. Grøndal, **M. E. Lien**, P. Lianto, W. Deng, R. K. Lillestøl, P. Lønning, J. B. Lorens, S. Knappskog, N. H. Halberg.  
  – Created a computer‑vision model to measure, quantify, and characterize adipocytes in multiplexed imaging modalities in a stain‑agnostic manner.  
  – Enabled proximal classification of “small” vs. “large” adipocytes per patient in multiplexed datasets that lack other measures of adiposity.

* **AdiFind: WIP** *Unpublished*.  
  **M. E. Lien**, K. Tran, N. H. Halberg.  
  – Software tool using mask R-CNN (X101 architecture) to process 100++ gigapixel whole‑slide images and automatically segment, quantify, and measure individual adipocytes, tumors, and other tissue structures.  
  – Implemented using Detectron2 and trained on manually annotated images of human and mouse adipose tissue. 

Work experience
======
* **Biotechnologist**, OptoScale — AI & Optics Team, Trondheim, Norway — *Jan 2022–Jun 2022*  
  – Annotated images of Atlantic salmon to train computer‑vision models for wound categories and salmon‑lice detection.  
  – Collected, organized, and prepared customer data for processing and analysis.

* **iGEM Team Member — Sulfind**, NTNU, Trondheim, Norway — *Mar 2020–Nov 2021*  
  – Developed a biosensor for detection of sublethal H₂S in water for early intervention in land‑based fish farms.  
  – Secured **250,000 NOK** in industry funding; awarded **Silver medal** and the **iGEM Team Impact Grant (USD 2,500)**, Paris, France.  
  – Led genetic engineering, experimental design, multimedia, and web design; created a bacterial fluorescent LOV‑based signal generator functional without molecular oxygen.

* **iGEM Team Leader — Sal.Coli**, University of Oslo (Trondheim/Oslo, Norway) — *May 2020–Nov 2020*  
  – Built an automated detection and treatment system for amoebic gill disease in Atlantic salmon.  
  – Awarded **Gold medal**; software nominated for **Best Software Tool** (Boston, USA); smallest team in competition history to achieve Gold and a special‑award nomination.  
  – Responsible for experimental design, genetic engineering, software, data visualization, multimedia, team organization, cross‑team collaborations, and industry‑media interviews.

Projects
======
* **Metabolic network layout using biochemical coordinates** — *Master’s thesis, September 2022*  
  – Created a new metabolic‑network layout using computed chemical features of metabolites (via RDKit) as coordinates to replace conventional layout algorithms.  
  – Evaluated combinations of chemical features that convey biological information and yield legible visualizations.

* **Hjernemoser (working title)** — *Educational board game, November 2018*  
  – Conceptualized and prototyped (Feb 2016). Sponsored by the Moser Laboratory and NTNU Department of Neuromedicine.  
  – Presented at **Neuroscience 2018** (Society for Neuroscience, San Diego) with the Dana Foundation as proxy.  
  – Considered for distribution as educational material for **Brain Awareness Week** (global outreach in 120 countries).
